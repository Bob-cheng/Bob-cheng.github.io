<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I earned my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://cs.purdue.edu) from [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu) in 2024, under the esteemed guidance of Samuel Conte Professor [Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). 
<!-- I also work closely with [Prof. Dongfang Liu](https://dongfang-liu.github.io/) and [Prof. Mingjie Tang](https://merlintang.github.io/).   -->
Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree with distinction in Computer Science from [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), and I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoguang Niu (WHU)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wxRS8nIAAAAJ) and [Prof. Jiannong Cao (PolyU)](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/) during my undergraduate studies. 

My research interest lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Security**, and I specialize in **Trustworthy Machine Learning**. Specifically, I focus on enhancing the robustness and security of AI-driven applications such as 3D perception, autonomous driving, robotic systems, etc. Additionally, I explore security topics around AI-generated content (AIGC) and foundation models/LLM.
