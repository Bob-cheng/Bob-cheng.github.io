<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at [Purdue University](https://cs.purdue.edu). I am fortunate to be advised by Samuel Conte Professor [Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). Previously, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology as an outstanding graduate from Wuhan University (WHU) in 2019, and I am grateful to have [Prof. Xiaoguang Niu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wxRS8nIAAAAJ) and [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/) as my initial advisors during the undergraduate study. 

My research interest lies in the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Security**, with a special focus on enhancing the robustness and security of AI-enabled applications (e.g., 3D perception, autonomous driving, AR/VR, etc.). I am also interested in the security topics around AI-generated content (AIGC) and foundation models.
